  ScreenLinks in an experiment to create concert or event visuals that audiences can easily play
  with from their phone’s web browser and collectively share on a large screen. The project aimed
  to give audience members a more personal way to connect with and influence a performance by
  providing controls that could be used at any time. Iterations of this project include a Space
  Invaders-style game that let players activate concert visuals, a drawing tool for Georgia
  State’s CMII Opening Day, and a multiplayer game for the Chemistry advertising agency.

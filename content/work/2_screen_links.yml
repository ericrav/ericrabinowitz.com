  Experimental audience interaction tool, where participants
  join a live experience from their phone’s web browser.
  Used as a series of concert visuals during the 9to5.tv festival,
  with assets by Pablo Gnecco and Derek Bruno.
  Iterations of this project include a Space Invaders-style game
  that let players activate concert visuals, a drawing tool for Georgia
  State’s CMII Opening Day, and a multiplayer game for the Chemistry advertising agency.

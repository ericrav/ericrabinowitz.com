  Storybooth is a phone booth in Montgomery, AL providing an inclusive,
  equitable opportunity for sharing, listening, and storytelling.
  Participants may use it at any time to tell their story,
  which is then uploaded to public archive for all to hear.
  Through the use of transcription and text analysis, a collective
  narrative picture will emerge offering a deeper understanding of
  our collective selves—of memory, of “place,” and of the love, pain,
  and hope that binds people together.
